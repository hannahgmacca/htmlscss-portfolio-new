## Description

### Purpose

The purpose of this portfolio is to demonstrate to teachers and potential future employers who I am and what I am capable of.

This includes my personal interests, hobbies and styles. The website is also used to show my working history, education and a space to highlight my projects.

This portfolio itself also serves as an opportunity to advance my abilities in website development. It is a project that allows me to begin practicing new skills in HTML/CSS/Ruby/React + more, as I can update and add new features as I learn them.
